# version-guard.sh  —  resolve the version a release is built and deployed as
#
# Usage:   bash scripts/version-guard.sh <repo-root> [version]
# Prints:  the version on stdout; every message goes to stderr.
#
# A release is named after a tag, so the build must be that tag, exactly:
#   - the working tree is clean (no modified, staged or untracked files —
#     an untracked source file is compiled in just the same);
#   - the version is a vX.Y.Z tag that points at HEAD (with no argument, the
#     one v* tag on HEAD is used);
#   - the tag is on origin, at the same commit, so the release can be found
#     and rebuilt from GitHub later.
#
# It refuses rather than guessing: a fallback such as `git describe || echo`
# always answers, including with a name that no build ever had.
#
# The same script lives in ascenda-backend (script/version-guard.sh); change
# both together.
